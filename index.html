        <h3>Short Biography</h3>
        <p>
          I am a mission-driven leader passionate about empowering teams, harnessing technology, and creating lasting impact. My journey began at the Eastern Mediterranean International School (EMIS), where I completed an International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma with a focus on economics and global politics, learning the power of collaboration across cultures. Following high school, I enlisted in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), earning my commission as an ICT Officer. In that capacity, I managed critical communication systems, oversaw operational planning, and refined my leadership skills under high-pressure conditions.<br><br>
          Later, I was accepted into the 8200-Signal Intelligence Unit, where I broadened my technical expertise and gained exposure to cutting-edge technological and intelligence initiatives. Upon concluding my four-year service, I returned to EMIS—this time as a Boarding School Social Guide—mentoring a diverse community of students and honing a people-centric approach to leadership. Simultaneously, I spearheaded a digital transformation project at EMIS, developing an internal application to streamline workflows. Currently pursuing a bachelor’s in Business Administration and Entrepreneurship at Reichman University, I remain committed to bridging innovation, education, and leadership to drive positive change in every organization I serve.

      <!-- Detailed Career Journey Narrative -->
      <div class="about-journey">
        <h3>My Story</h3>
        <p>
          My story is one of continuous growth and purposeful challenge. Raised with a belief in stepping outside comfort zones, I took my first significant leap by enrolling at the Eastern Mediterranean International School (EMIS). This international environment, rich with diverse perspectives, shaped my global outlook. Studying economics and global politics sparked my fascination with the mechanisms that drive impactful change—both on a local and international scale.<br><br>
          After completing my IB diploma, I enlisted in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) for my mandatory service. Driven by a desire to merge my interests in technology and leadership, I was accepted into the Combat ICT Officers course. The rigorous training and subsequent role as Deputy Battalion C4I Officer in the 405th artillery battalion tested my adaptability and resilience. I learned to manage large-scale communication systems under operational pressures, collaborating with teams to ensure seamless information flow in dynamic settings.<br><br>
          Eager to deepen my expertise, I transitioned to a classified role in the 8200-Signal Intelligence Unit. There, I gained exposure to advanced technological tools and honed my analytical skills. This period underscored the importance of strategic thinking and swift decision-making in maintaining a competitive edge.<br><br>
          When my four-year service concluded, I chose to give back to the institution that had launched my global journey. I returned to EMIS as a Boarding School Social Guide, focusing on mentorship, cross-cultural understanding, and fostering leadership among students. Simultaneously, I began developing an internal App to automate processes and enhance team efficiency—an initiative that combined my passion for technology with my commitment to empowering others.<br><br>
          Currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration and Entrepreneurship at Reichman University, I am dedicated to leveraging my leadership background, technological expertise, and global perspective to create value in every project I undertake. My ultimate goal is to blend human-centered leadership with cutting-edge innovation, ensuring that teams not only achieve their objectives but also thrive in the process.
